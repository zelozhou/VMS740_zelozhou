# CLAYFLIX

Clayflix is a bespoke streaming service designed for claymation aficionados. It offers a curated selection of claymation films, fostering a community space for discussion and appreciation, while emphasizing simplicity, user engagement, and an intimate connection to the cratfsmanship of clay animation.

The images used are mostly from film posters, which allow non-commercial use.

The LOGO was designed by me using Midjourney.

The links leads to sites in which the films are screened. THEY ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY LICENSED TO PLAY THEM. But it's ok for you to watch them (often approved by production individual and company)
