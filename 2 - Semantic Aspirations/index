                As David Marriot points out in his essay 'Inventions of Existence: Sylvia Wynter, Frantz Fanon,
                Sociogeny, and "the Damned' "Fanon makes a certain reference to history, which he contrasts to that of
                invention and that of self-creation:"

                    "I am not a prisoner of History [l'Histoire]. I should not seek there for the meaning of my destiny.
                    I should constantly remind myself that the real leap [le v√©ritable saut] consists in introducing
                    invention into existence. In the world through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself."
